  <td>
    An extensible tool for automating the <a href="https://ct2s.insigneo.org/ct2s/"><alt>CT2S Pipeline</alt></a>. Allowing users to build and drop in personal scripts that allow others to perform finite element method analysis with minimal training.
    Time reductions of up to 70% have been seen from using the tool.

  </td>
  <td>
    A system for performing regression testing on CSV format data files in LaTeX, written purely in Lua for use with LuaLaTeX. Includes the ability to fit polynomials of multiple orders to data, and plot the results using PGFPlots. Offers some additional features such as the ability to generate confidence intervals and perform R<sup>2</sup> tests on the data.

    This guide is designed to provide a good starting point for those looking to use LaTeX for academic writing. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide, but rather a general purpose guide that will provide a good foundation for those looking to use LaTeX for academic writing and the transition from other word processing software.
