    An extensible tool for automating the <a href="https://ct2s.insigneo.org/ct2s/"><alt>CT2S Pipeline</alt></a>. Allowing users to build and drop in personal scripts that allow others to perform finite element method analysis with minimal training.
    Time reductions of up to 70% have been seen from using the tool.
